# AI Projects

## Purpose
The two programming assignments for my CS 480 course. These covered best first search algorithms and constraint satisfaction problems. While they are fairly basic, they are another example of my personal coding style and what techniques I prefer to use.

## Project Description
These projects both do the same thing, which is find a path that solves a problem. For the best first search project, the goal was to get from one state to another in the shortest distance while only travelling through capitals. The constraint satisfaction project does this as well, but only allows travel from east to west, and another input is the minimum number of state parks a path must travel through.

## Usage of Files

### Best First Search

In command prompt or an equivalent terminal, and find your way to the folder. Then run the following line, replacing the prompts with your own states. (use initial for states)
```
python cs480_P01_A20459012.py INITIAL_STATE GOAL_STATE
```

### Constraint Satisfaction Problem

In command prompt or an equivalent terminal, and find your way to the folder. Then run the following line, replacing the prompts. (use initial for states)
```
python cs480_P02_A20459012.py INITIAL_STATE MIN_PARKS
```
